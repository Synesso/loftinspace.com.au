                        I believe it is worthwhile to make a distinction between the two. In this post, I highlight
                        the different strategies for determining whether to build a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) or a prototype. It is a conscious decision that needs to be made during the concept phase.

                        Many creative people (e.g. artists and writers) I know prefer to work on their own. In the technology space,
                        in order to take a sizeable creative idea from inception to implementation, it usually takes a team of
                        people collaborating closely together. It is through teamwork and a clear common vision that a creative
                        concept gradually takes shape, with input from everyone in the team who has complementary skills.

                <p>I recently finished writing a Twitter bot that helps development teams using
                    a proprietary agile planning tool to celebrate their
                    wins by tweeting about completed stories. This small program had me exploring the parallelisation
                    of simple tasks using the Future monad.</p>

                <p>In a highly-available application, it is occasionally necessary to have some processing performed in
                    isolation within a cluster, whilst still allowing for processing to continue should the designated
                    worker node fail. This is trivial with Akka clustering support for the Cluster Singleton
                    pattern.</p>

                <p>Many years ago I was walking through the office when I passed a colleague talking to our manager. I
                    overheard him as he was putting forward the case for using Ruby - "The great thing about dynamic[ly
                    typed] languages is that they <em>force</em> you to write tests", he said. Because our manager was
                    already committed to the importance of high test coverage, the idea of putting natural pressure on
                    developers to write tests was probably quite appealing.</p>
