            Hi, and welcome to
            <span class="logo inline">Loft in Space</span>
          </p>
          <p>My name is Jem Mawson. I am a software engineer living in Melbourne, Australia with my wife and a miniature dachshund.</p>
          <p>
            I started programming in the mid 1980s when I received (begged for) a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_16">Commodore 16</a> for my birthday. I have been fascinated with building software ever since. I have been working in technology since the mid 1990s and have dedicated much of this time to developing software using agile methodologies.
          </p>
          <p>I am keenly interested in the pursuit of quality through automated testing techniques and functional programming. I enjoy learning from and sharing my knowledge with other developers on these topics and more. My programming experience includes many languages (primarily Java, Scala, Ruby and JavaScript) in banking and various other industries developing web-based and complex back-end systems.</p>
          <p>My strengths are in crafting software that meets business objectives in a pragmatic and efficient manner and improving development and build processes, through the introduction and implementation of new tooling and other changes.</p>
          <p>
            In my spare time, I practice <a href="http://www.shadowyoga.com/">Shadow Yoga</a>, which is a Hatha Yoga system designed to integrate the common principles of yoga, martial arts, Indian dance and Ayurveda in order to cultivate strength and mindfulness. The practice of Shadow Yoga is to free the body of restrictions (conceptualised as layers of shadows), which in turn releases the mind from conditioning. I also love travelling, <a href="http://abcjazz.net.au/">jazz</a>, drinking great coffee and playing with our little dachshund.
