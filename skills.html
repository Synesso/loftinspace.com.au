            <p>Jeremy started programming in the mid 1980s and has been fascinated with building software ever since.
                He has been working in technology since the mid 1990s and has dedicated much of this time to
                developing software using agile methodologies.
            </p>

            <p>He is keenly interested in the pursuit of quality through automated testing techniques and functional
                programming. He enjoys learning from and sharing his knowledge with development teams on these topics
                and more. His programming experience includes many languages in various industries developing web-based
                and complex back-end systems.</p>

            <p>Jeremy's strengths are in crafting software that meets business objectives in a pragmatic and efficient
                manner and improving software development, through the introduction and implementation of
                lightweight tooling and processes.</p>
