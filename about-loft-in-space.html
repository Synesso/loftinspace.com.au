            <p>
                Jeremy started programming in the mid 1980s and has been fascinated with building software ever since.
                He has been creating and delivering software since the mid 1990s in various industries developing high
                throughput web-based and back-end systems.

                His technical interests include functional programming, high-performance, fault-tolerant processing and
                software development best practises (e.g. TDD, property based testing and static typing).
                He specialises in the Scala programming language and has an extensive capability in many other languages
                and platforms (including Java, JavaScript, Ruby, Clojure, Python, Groovy, Haskell). He is practised in

                pursuit of quality through automated testing techniques and functional programming. He enjoys learning
                from and sharing his knowledge with development teams on these topics and more.

                Jeremy's strengths are in crafting software that meets business objectives in a pragmatic and efficient
                manner and improving software development through the introduction and implementation of lightweight
                tooling and processes.
