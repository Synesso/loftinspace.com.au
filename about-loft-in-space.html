            <p>Hi, welcome to Loft in Space. We are a husband and wife team, living in Australia with our miniature
                dachshund. We are passionate about building innovative and socially responsible software.</p>

                We like to collaborate with and help smart people on projects that make a positive
                difference to communities and the environment.</p>

            <p>Jeremy started programming in the mid 1980s and has been fascinated with building software ever since.
                He has been working in technology since the mid 1990s and has dedicated much of this time to
                developing software using agile methodologies.
            </p>

            <p>He is keenly interested in the pursuit of quality through automated testing techniques and functional
                programming. He enjoys learning from and sharing his knowledge with development teams on these topics
                and more. His programming experience includes many languages in various industries developing web-based
                and complex back-end systems.</p>

            <p>Jeremy's strengths are in crafting software that meets business objectives in a pragmatic and efficient
                manner and improving software development, through the introduction and implementation of
                lightweight tooling and processes.</p>

            <p>Chen has a Chinese background and a master's degree in engineering. She's worked in technology since the
                late 90s. Her work ranges from product management, project management, analysis, testing, and team
                management.
            </p>

            <p>Her interest lies in strategic analysis, developing business and product plans, product functional
                design,
                as well as evaluating business and product benefits/performance/costs in order to deliver changes in the
                most efficient way.</p>

            <p>Chen's strengths are in conceptualising complex requirements, simplifying and clearly defining them just
                on the right level for problem solving. Her strong technical background combined with commercial acumen
                enables her to collaborate with both technical and business professionals to develop fit-for-purpose
                solutions that are aligned with business strategies.</p><br>

            <p>In our spare time we are avid yoga practitioners. Our practice of yoga is training for growth, transformation,
                sustained concentration, discovery and expanding our vision of what is possible by stretching our
                capabilities to manage challenges mindfully with each step we take.
