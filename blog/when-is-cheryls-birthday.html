                    When is Cheryl's Birthday? (Scala)
                </h1>
            </div>

            <div id="copy" class="copy">
                <p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheryl%27s_Birthday">This puzzle</a> was popularised recently
                    and caused many people headaches. You've probably heard about it. I want to demonstrate a thinking
                    approach that makes the puzzle very easy to solve. But first, a refresher.</p>

                <div class="inset">
                    <p>Cheryl is very cryptic. She wants her two friends to know her birthday, but not know it at the same
                        time. She gives them a list of possible dates:</p>

<pre><code class="prettyprint">May 15, 16, 19
June 17, 18
July 14, 16
August 14, 15, 17
</code></pre>

                    <p>She then tells Albert the month, and Bernard the day of month and feels very happy with
                        herself. At this point, Albert and Bernard should share their knowledge with each other and then
                        everyone would know Cheryl's birthday, but instead they have this conversation:</p>

                    <p>
                        <strong>Albert</strong>: I don't know when Cheryl's birthday is, but I know that Bernard doesn't know too.<br/>
                        <strong>Bernard</strong>: At first I didn't know when Cheryl's birthday is, but I know now.<br/>
                        <strong>Albert</strong>: Then I also know when Cheryl's birthday is.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <p>The last person to know Cheryl's birthday, it would seem, is us. So how do we solve this puzzle?
                    The secret is to think a lot about sets. No, I said "sets".</p>

                <p>We start with a set of possible answers and need to reduce this set to a singleton set (that is, a
                    set with only one value) by inferring clues from the conversation between Albert and Bernard.</p>

<pre><code class="prettyprint">{ May 15, May 16, May 19, June 17, June 18, July 14, July 16, August 14, August 15, August 17 } =&gt; { ? }
</code></pre>

                <h3>Clue #1</h3>

                <p>Albert says <em>I don't know when Cheryl's birthday is, but I know that Bernard doesn't know too</em>.
                    There are two parts to this statement.</p>

                <p>1: <em>I don't know when Cheryl's birthday is</em></p>

                <p>This is obvious. Albert knows the month only. There is no way we can take one of the four months and
                    reduce to a singleton set. Albert's knowledge could only be one of the following:</p>

<pre><code class="prettyprint">May =&gt;    { May 15, May 16, May 19 }
June =&gt;   { June 17, June 18 }
July =&gt;   { July 14, July 16 }
August =&gt; { August 14, August 15, August 17 }
</code></pre>

                <p>The second part is more telling.</p>

                <p>2: <em>but I know that Bernard doesn't know too</em></p>

                <p>It seems that Albert has done some analysis on what Bernard knows, just as we have done on his. And
                    he's come to a definitive conclusion - that Bernard also doesn't know.</p>

                <p>So what could Bernard's knowledge be before the first clue? He is given a day, which allows him to
                    reduce the sets to one of:</p>

<pre><code class="prettyprint">14 =&gt; { July 14, August 14 }
15 =&gt; { May 15, August 15 }
16 =&gt; { May 16, July 16 }
17 =&gt; { June 17, August 17 }
18 =&gt; { June 18 }
19 =&gt; { May 19 }
</code></pre>

                <p>We see that two day-of-month values <code class="prettyprint">{ 18, 19 }</code> resolve to singletons.
                    Receiving either of these dates would have ensured that Bernard
                    <em>knew</em> the birthday. When Albert states that he <em>knows</em> that Bernard doesn't know, we can infer
                    that the month Albert received must not be paired with a unique day-of-month. That means the month
                    cannot be in <code class="prettyprint">{ May, June }</code>. To be clear, if it was May, then there's
                    a chance that the date could be 19 and therefore a chance that Bernard does know. Likewise with
                    June and 18.</p>

                <p>As observers, we can now reduce the set of possible answers by removing May and June from</p>

<pre><code class="prettyprint">{ May 15, May 16, May 19, June 17, June 18, July 14, July 16, August 14, August 15, August 17 }
</code></pre>

                <p>to</p>

<pre><code class="prettyprint">{ July 14, July 16, August 14, August 15, August 17 }
</code></pre>

                <h3>Clue #2</h3>

                <p>Having quickly understood all of this, Bernard responds with <em>At first I didn't know when Cheryl's
                    birthday is, but I know now</em>.</p>

                <p>Something changed after hearing Albert speak. Bernard previously had one of the following in
                    mind:</p>

<pre><code class="prettyprint">14 =&gt; { July 14, August 14 }
15 =&gt; { May 15, August 15 }
16 =&gt; { May 16, July 16 }
17 =&gt; { June 17, August 17 }
</code></pre>

                <p>But on hearing Albert say that Bernard doesn't know, Bernard can infer exactly as we did in the step
                    above - May and June are out. This leaves him with these options:</p>

<pre><code class="prettyprint">14 =&gt; { July 14, August 14 }
15 =&gt; { August 15 }
16 =&gt; { July 16 }
17 =&gt; { August 17 }
</code></pre>

                <p>He states that he now definitively knows what the answer is, so he must have been given a date that
                    resolves to a singleton set. We can remove the 14th on this basis:</p>

<pre><code class="prettyprint">15 =&gt; { August 15 }
16 =&gt; { July 16 }
17 =&gt; { August 17 }
</code></pre>

                <p>Leaving us observers with a further reduced set of possible answers from:</p>

<pre><code class="prettyprint">{ July 14, July 16, August 14, August 15, August 17 }
</code></pre>

                <p>to</p>

<pre><code class="prettyprint">{ July 16, August 15, August 17 }
</code></pre>

                <h3>Clue #3</h3>

                <p>Again, having displayed deductive acuity to rival Sherlock Holmes, Albert claims <em>Then I also know
                    when Cheryl's birthday is</em>. Using the same reasoning as in step 2, we can come to the answer
                    also. Recall that before Bernard spoke, Albert knew the possible answers were:</p>

<pre><code class="prettyprint">July =&gt; { July 14, July 16 }
August =&gt; { August 14, August 15, August 17 }
</code></pre>

                <p>But after hearing that Bernard knew the answer, and realising it can't be the 14th of any month,
                    Bernard's options are reduced to:</p>

<pre><code class="prettyprint">July =&gt; { July 16 }
August =&gt; { August 15, August 17 }
</code></pre>

                <p>And, as Bernard proclaims that he knows the birthday, then his given month must map to a singleton
                    set. The answer must be July 16.</p>

                <h3>The Code</h3>

                <p>Here is the above logic put far more succinctly into code.</p>
