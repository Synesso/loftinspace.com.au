            </div>

            <div>
                <p>The terms Minimum Viable Product (MVP) and prototype are often used
                    interchangeably in most of the technical literature and blogs. While working with startups, I have
                    observed much confusion caused by this. I believe it is worthwhile to make a distinction between the
                    two. In this post, I highlight the different strategies for determining whether to build an
                    MVP or a prototype. It is a conscious decision that needs to be made during the concept phase. </p>


                <h2><span style="color: darkgreen">What are they?</span></h2>

                <p><span style="font-weight:bold">Prototype</span> is a model of a product built to test or demonstrate
                    the feasibility of a concept. </p>

                <p><span style="font-weight:bold;">Minimum Viable Product (MVP)</span>, while also serving the purpose of
                    maximising validated learning for the least amount of effort, is built with the most basic set of
                    features that allow the product to be functional and deployed into production in order to accelerate
                    time to market for new product introduction. It is more than a proof of concept.</p>

                <p>The original term MVP was defined by Frank Robinson, and popularised by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Blank">Steve Blank</a>,
                    and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Ries">Eric Ries</a>
                    (for web applications) as a key concept in <a href="http://theleanstartup.com/principles">Lean
                        Startup Methodology</a>. However, the two concepts are not differentiated.</p>

                <h2><span style="color: darkgreen">How are they different? </h2>

                <p>An <span style="font-weight:bold">MVP</span> is the first version of software fit for release to
                    customers. It has enough functionality to be considered useful and to kick off the
                    build-measure-learn feedback loop. The purpose is to maximise learning from early customer feedback
                    with the least amount of implementation effort. The design and implementation process requires some rigour and discipline with a high level long
                    term product strategy in mind, in order to set out a good foundation for future development. </p>

                <p> A <span style="font-weight:bold">prototype</span> on the other hand is built as quickly as possible
                    to prove or disprove the viability of a planned solution. The focus of a prototype design is its
                    presentation and usually not fit for deployment into production. It might not even be software.
                    Paper and Power Point prototypes are popular methods for getting a feel for the usability and
                    features of a product. </p>

                <p> <span style="font-weight:bold">Prototypes</span> are designed for a small audience and should be thrown away. However, it is frequently
                    the case that successful prototypes are built upon; a tactic that leads to unnecessary long-term pain. Using
                    prototype as a foundation for production software will incur a large amount of <a
                            href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/TechnicalDebt.html">technical debt</a> (a concept
                    introduced by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ward_Cunningham">Ward Cunningham</a>), as there isn't the time and resources available to build good code
                    and practices before delivery. If it is subsequently used as the basis for ongoing product
                    development, organisations will have to "pay interest" in the form of slower development progress,
                    or "pay principle" in the form of rewriting the poorly designed code.
                </p>

                <p> An <span style="font-weight:bold">MVP</span> is usually released to a sizable user group (e.g. a
                    trial or
                    the standard user group) in order to collect user feedback and market data. You let these customers
                    loose
                    on your MVP before implementing the complete set of functionality, so that the feedback from
                    customers can
                    guide future product development. A <span style="font-weight:bold">prototype</span> is more for the
                    purpose of demonstrating a product idea and therefore, is not usually released to any target market
                    customers to be used. </p>

                <p>The term <span style="font-weight:bold">MVP</span> has been a particularly popular concept in the context of startups. Even those who have
                    popularised the term have sometimes referred to it as <em>prototype</em> MVP and state that the letter 'P' in
                    the acronym is misleading. In my view, videos, mock-ups and presentations are not MVPs. Apart from serving
                    the same purposes of testing product hypothesis with minimal effort and
                    accelerating learning, MVPs should also deliver tangible initial customer value. Prototypes only
                    demonstrate promised value. </p>

                <h2><span style="color: darkgreen">How to choose between them?</h2>

                <p>When deciding whether to build a prototype or an MVP, it is a good idea to consider the following
                    questions:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>What is the vision of the product?</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>What are the target user groups and what needs does the product address for them? This question
                        determines what are the product hypothesises that you are testing i.e. the goal of the prototype
                        or MVP.
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>What is the competitive landscape and what are the product differentiators? Or if it is a
                        technical solution for the internal business, what problems does the software solve?
                    </li>
                </ol>


                <p>Whether you decide an MVP or a prototype is the right thing to build first, ideally the design should
                    clearly reflect the product vision in some form and the key market differentiators (i.e. what
                    problems the product is attempting to solve). </p>

                <p>To determine what to build, the questions to ask are:</p>

                <ol>
                    <li>What is the purpose of the prototype or MVP, i.e. what are the riskiest assumptions that require
                        validation?
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Who are the users/audience you want to collect feedback from?</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>What is the funding strategy? What are the available budget and resources, and timeframe
                        targets?
                    </li>
                </ol>

                <p> Depending on what hypothesis is to be validated, a prototype is often sufficient and no development
                    might be required. It is of course perfectly valid to build a simple prototype first before
                    developing an MVP. </p>

                <p>Steve Blank who started the lean movement gave a good example on this point in his post <a
                        href="http://steveblank.com/2013/07/22/an-mvp-is-not-a-cheaper-product-its-about-smart-learning/">
                        "An MVP is not a Cheaper Product, It's about Smart Learning."</a>


                    Blank recommended to the team they <em>rent</em> the hardware and process the data <em>by hand</em> - an approach that
                    took significantly less time and initial investment then their original plan of implementing the hardware
                    and software solution with a minimum set of features.
                    In this post, Steve referred to the solution to test the hypothesis as an MVP. The
                    recommendation he gave to the team was to put together a demonstrable proof of concept - an MVP based
                    on his definition but a prototype if we differentiate prototypes from MVPs. It is precisely due to the confusion
                    within engineering teams (who are inclined to build an MVP when a prototype might suffice) and novice technology
                    entrepreneurs (who might confuse brochureware for production-worthy software),
                    I believe it is valuable to make the distinction between the two. </p>

                <p>Assuming you agree with my definition of MVP being the first iteration of production worthy software,
                    deciding to build an MVP requires commitment and I would advise going through the preliminary
                    analysis with the view to establish a viable <span style="font-weight:bold">business case</span>
                    before proceeding. </p>

                <p>The purpose of a <span style="font-weight:bold">business case</span> is to qualitatively and
                    quantitatively rationalise an investment. Apart from stating the business objective, it estimates
                    the expected benefits and costs in measurable terms e.g. Return on Investment (ROI), pay back
                    period, initial investment (including internal and external) and projected cash flow. Also, it
                    outlines the critical success factors and identifies the key risks, issues and dependencies. A
                    business case is a living artefact that evolves throughout the implementation of the product and is
                    used to validate if the overall project is on track at key stage gates. </p>

                <p>So why would a team decide to implement an MVP instead of building a prototype first? It could be
                    that the business case and product concept are sound, and there is enough funding and minimal risks.
                    If this is the case and the priority is to launch a functional lean product to gather more extensive
                    user feedback, MVP would be the right thing to build.</p>

                <h2><span style="color: darkgreen">What to watch out for? </h2>

                <p>The biggest challenge (as demonstrated in Steve Blank's post mentioned above) is to clearly define
                    exactly what concept is to be validated and what is the most effective way to validate it. Once the
                    goal is clear, the other challenges are scoping and design. </p>

                <p>In building an MVP, the objective is to achieve the optimum balance between maximising investment
                    return/learning and minimising risks. From a scoping perspective, to minimise risks, it is
                    absolutely necessary to do some high level market data gathering and user requirement analysis. From
                    a technical perspective, it is difficult to get the balance right to not only quickly elicit market
                    response, but also lay out a good quality foundation for future work. However, taking too long to
                    build a perfect MVP may cause you to miss the market window. Accept and understand that incurring
                    some level of technical debt at the early stage is inevitable and a quick feedback loop would allow
                    accelerated learning. When the uncertainties and risks early on during the project are high,
                    knowledge acquisition is of the highest priority. The objective of gaining knowledge in order to
                    build the right thing needs be delicately balanced with building it
                    fast and building it right. </p>

                <p>The Concept Phase is a critical time for any project whether it is in a startup environment or an
                    established business, when many challenging decisions are to be made. An experienced team
                    understands the trade-offs, risks and rewards, and makes their decisions consciously and
                    strategically. </p>
