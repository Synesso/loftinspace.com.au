                Working with Futures
            </h1>

            <div id="copy" class="copy">
                <p>I recently finished writing a Twitter bot. It helps development teams using
                    <a href="http://www.rallydev.com/">Rally</a> (a proprietary agile planning tool) to celebrate their
                    wins by tweeting about recently completed stories. It has a simple 3-stage process:</p>

                <ol>
                    <li>retrieve status from Rally</li>
                    <li>compare this status update with previous status update to see what's new</li>
                    <li>tweet about anything that is newly completed.</li>
                </ol>

                <p>The main technologies used are: Spray HTTP Client, Typesafe config, json4s, scala-pickling and
                    twitter4j. You can <a href="https://github.com/Synesso/soymilky/blob/master/src/main/scala/soymilky/RallyToTwitter.scala">
                    view the source of the bot</a>, or see it in action <a href="https://twitter.com/farnsworthtalks">
                    @farnsworthtalks</a>. The configuration is externalised, so you can run a variant of your own, if
                    that's useful to you.</p>

                <p>In this project I haved used futures throughout. For me futures often feel natural after a
                    brief, initial period of confusion. Only after I reacquaint myself with them do things begin to flow.
                    Proficiency and fluency with futures is a good thing, because once you have a future you need to
                    keep modelling your application as future operations, or suffer the penalty of blocking for a result.
                    For me at least, I need to practice, practice and practice some more until they are second nature.</p>

                <p>In my bot, the first step is to retrieve an HTTP payload. Using Spray HTTP Client this is returned in
                    a <code>Future</code>. Once you have a <code>Future</code> you are propelled forward within this
                    monadic context to find and merge (<code>flatMap</code>) in more and more futures. Getting used to
                    thinking in futures can be difficult, but as i have found it is worthwhile as it imbues parallelism
                    throughout your application code.</p>

                <p>Retrieving a remote HTTP payload is seamless, and results in our first Future. This is mapped through
                    json4s parsing logic that converts the String payload into workable case classes:</p>

<pre><code class="prettyprint">val byRecordType: Seq[Future[Set[Story]]] = Seq("story", "defect").map{recordType =>
  val svc = url(urlFor(recordType, teamName)).as(user, pass)
  val json: Future[JValue] = Http(svc OK as.String).map(parse(_)).map{ _ \ "QueryResult" \ "Results" }
  json.map(_.children.map{result: JValue =>
    result.extract[Story]
  }.toSet)
}
</code></pre>

                <p>The result type is a temporally current collection with Futures within. In other words a Seq that
                    exists right now, filled with Sets that will exist in the future. A common transformation on such a
                    structure is to sequence these inner futures into a single future collection. This is an important
                    act of simplification, as I am not interested in the collection until all its members are actualised.
                    Whilst I have a <code>Seq[Future[T]]</code>, what I really need is a <code>Future[Seq[T]]</code>.</p>

                </figure>
                <figcaption>Sequencing Futures into a single Future</figcaption>

                <p>In the
                    <a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/reactive">Coursera Principles of Reactive Programming
                    course</a> students are asked to
                    write this future warping logic themselves. It's a lot of fun, but thankfully the standard library
                    provies the necessary generic functionality in the
                    <a href="https://www.scala-lang.org/api/current/#scala.concurrent.Future$">Future.sequence</a>
                    method.</p>

                <p>With a set of Stories (that will be parsed in the future) in hand, the next step is to compare this
                    to the stories that were found in previous runs. This is done using scala-pickling, using a
                    synchronous API. As the application logic is already in the land of the future, it makes sense to
                    explicitly wrap this synchronous operation in a future, so that we can enjoy parallelism between
                    this function and the ones that follow.</p>

                <p>The unpickling is enabled simply with this code:</p>

<pre><code class="prettyprint">Future { Source.fromFile(storiesFile).mkString.unpickle[Map[String, Set[Story]]] }</code></pre>

                <p>Finding what stories are newly completed is a set complement operation on the values within
                    the future. Using a for-comprehension the complement can also be queued up to complete in the
                    future.</p>

<pre><code class="prettyprint">val newStories: FutureStories = for {
  all <- allStories
  fromBefore <- storiesFromLastRun
} yield all.map{ case (k, v) => (k, v -- fromBefore.getOrElse(k, Set.empty))}
</code></pre>

                <p>Tweeting these new stories is trivial using twitter4j. (This
                    <a href="http://bcomposes.wordpress.com/2013/02/26/using-twitter4j-with-scala-to-perform-user-actions/">
                        blog post</a>
                    explains the process well). After ensuring the <code>TwitterFactory</code> is configured with the
                    correct secret credentials, we need only call <code>updateStatus</code>. Again, this is synchronous,
                    so it has been manually wrapped in a Future. This is not entirely necessary, as blocking the
                    tweeting operations would simplify the exit condition for the process. However, I included it for
                    what I artistically feel is a necessary sense of symmetry.</p>

                <pre><code class="prettyprint">Future { twitter.updateStatus(message) }</code></pre>

                <p>At the end of the process, there are two values to be awaited before the process can terminate.
                    Firstly the tweeting, and secondly the serialisation to file of the latest known list of completed
                    stories. Either operation may finish before the other in theory, so both future results of these
                    operations are sequenced to a single Future and the process awaits its completion (or blows the
                    stack if something went wrong).

<pre><code class="prettyprint">val finalValue = Future.sequence(Seq(storiesFile, statuses))
finalValue.onFailure{case t: Throwable => throw t}
Await.ready(finalValue, 1 minute)
</code></pre>

                <p>The most complex aspect of working with futures was the situation where I needed to transform a
                    <code>Map[A, Future[B]]</code> into a <code>Future[Map[A, B]]</code>. This is another take on the
                    sequencing of a collection of futures, but there is no standard library method to make this easy
                    for maps. The essence of the solution is to migrate the <code>A</code> into the <code>Future</code>,
                    by transforming the <code>Future[B]</code> into a <code>Future[(A,B)]</code>, discarding the
                    original <code>A</code> and sequencing the resulting <code>Iterable[Future[(A,B)]]</code> into a
                    <code>Future[Iterable[(A,B)]]</code>, then mapping these future tuples into a <code>Map</code>.
                    The transformation looks like this:</p>

<pre><code class="prettyprint">type A = Int; type B = Int
val myMap: Map[A, Future[B]] = Map(1 -> Future(2))
val iterFutureTuples: Iterable[Future[(A,B)]] = myMap.map{case (a,b) => b.map(bb => (a,bb))}
val futureIterTuples: Future[Iterable[(A,B)]] = Future.sequence(iterFutureTuples)
val futureMap: Future[Map[A,B]] = futureIterTuples.map(_.toMap)
</code></pre>

                    <img src="img/sequencing-maps.png" alt="diagram: sequencing maps with future values into a single future"/>
                </figure>
                <figcaption>Sequencing a Map with Future values into a single Future</figcaption>

                <p>Or more succinctly as:</p>

<pre><code class="prettyprint">Future.sequence(myMap.map{case (a,b) => b.map(bb => (a,bb))}).map(_.toMap)</code></pre>

                <p>In my experience the initial barrier to working with futures is similar to that experience when first
                    encountering Options and other monadic types. This feels more complex again because of the tendency
                    to think in terms of time. But by putting aside temporal concerns and considering Future as just
                    another monadic context, they begin to feel natural.</p>

                <p>What is your experience programming using Scala futures? Do you have any insights to share? I would
                    appreciate your thoughts below.</p>
